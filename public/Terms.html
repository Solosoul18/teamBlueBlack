                                <p>
                                    Last Updated March 11, 2020 </p>

                                <p>Please review these Terms of Use carefully.</p>

                               <p> IMPORTANT: THESE TERMS OF USE CONTAIN A MANDATORY ARBITRATION PROVISION THAT, AS FURTHER
                                SET FORTH IN SECTION 20 BELOW, REQUIRES THE USE OF ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS TO
                                RESOLVE DISPUTES. THIS MEANS THAT YOU AND THE WALMART ENTITIES ARE EACH GIVING UP THE
                                RIGHT TO SUE EACH OTHER IN COURT OR IN CLASS ACTIONS OF ANY KIND. IN ARBITRATION, THERE
                                IS NO JUDGE OR JURY AND THERE IS LESS DISCOVERY AND APPELLATE REVIEW THAN IN COURT.

                                connection with the Walmart Sites. Any text in Content should be written in English. You
                                acknowledge and agree that you are responsible for all Content and Ideas you make
                                available in connection with any Walmart Site. You represent and warrant that (1) you
                                have the authority to grant the rights in such Content and Ideas as set forth in these
                                Terms of Use, including in Section 3(B) below; and (2) such Content and Ideas, and the
                                use of such Content and Ideas, will not violate any term of these Terms of Use. This

                                originality, and your rights in any such Content and Ideas.

                                B. Walmart’s Rights to Use Content and Ideas
                                You grant to Walmart a royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, unlimited,
                                nonexclusive license to use, reproduce, create derivative works from, modify, publish,
                                edit, translate, distribute, perform and display (publicly or otherwise) any Content
                                that you make available, in any media or medium, and in any form, format, or forum now
                                known or hereafter developed. You further agree that Walmart is free to use any Ideas
                                for any purpose. Walmart may sublicense its rights in Content and Ideas through multiple

                                Content or Idea in confidence; (2) to pay any compensation for any Content or Idea; or
                                (3) to respond to any Content or Idea. You grant to Walmart the right to use any name
                                associated with any Content or Idea that you make available to Walmart, although Walmart
                                has no obligation to exercise such right, or to otherwise provide any attribution for
                                any Content or Idea.

                                4. Monitoring by Walmart
                                Walmart will have the right (but not the obligation), in our sole discretion, to
                                monitor, evaluate, and analyze Content, and any use of and access to the Walmart Sites,
